Welcome to the **WorkoutEmpire API**! This repository serves as the backend for the comprehensive WorkoutEmpire platform, which is currently under development. I'm working to provide users with a vast array of different exercises and workout routines. With this API, users will track their exercises, record time and weights used, monitor their progress in areas such as strength, flexibility, and cardio, and build their fitness empire using the tools and knowledge provided.

## Present features
- **Workout Routines**: Users can create workout routines based on their preferences.
- **Exercise Filtering**
- **Users Management**
- **Save favorite exercises and workout routines**
- **Workout Sessions**: Users can log their exercises, including details such sets, reps, weights used and the date on which they performed each exercise. Algo, users can get the all the previous
workout session made.

## Planned Features
The WorkoutEmpire API aims to provide the following features:
- **Exercise Tracking**: Users will be able to log their exercises, including details such as exercise type, duration, sets, reps, and weights used.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Users will be able to track their progress, allowing users to monitor their development over time.
- **Personalization**: The API will provide recommendations based on user preferences.

## Technology Stack
The WorkoutEmpire API is built with the following technologies:

- Python
- Django Rest Framework
- PostgreSQL
- Docker Compose

## API Documentation
The API documentation is currently in progress and will be made available soon. I'm working on providing comprehensive documentation for the API endpoints, request formats, and response structures. Stay tuned for updates!
